# üìä Shield Insurance Power BI Dashboard Project

## üè¢ About the Project

This is an **insurance domain** project completed as part of my **Virtual Internship with AtliQ Technologies**. (via Codebasics Bootcamp)
**Shield Insurance** operates in five major Indian cities:  
- Mumbai  
- New Delhi  
- Chennai  
- Hyderabad  
- Indore  

The company offers **9 different insurance products** and reaches its customers through **four distinct sales modes**:
- Offline Agents  
- Offline Direct

Customers are segmented into **six age groups**:
- 18‚Äì24  
- 25‚Äì30  
- 31‚Äì40  
- 41‚Äì50  
- 51‚Äì65  
- 65+

## üéØ Objective of the Project

Using 6 months of customer and sales data, I performed the following analysis:

- Calculated **total number of customers** and **total revenue**
- Tracked **daily growth** in revenue and customer count
- Analyzed **month-over-month performance**
- Performed **city-wise and age-wise segmentation**
- Analyzed **sales mode performance** across age groups and months
- Evaluated **policy preferences** by age groups
- Computed **customer and revenue split (%)** by sales mode

### üßæ Separate pages created for:
- **General Overview**  
- **Sales Mode Analysis**  
- **Age Group Analysis**

## üß≠ Dashboard Structure

The Power BI dashboard is divided into **four main pages**:

1. **Home Page** ‚Äì Acts as a navigation hub to all sections  
2. **General Overview** ‚Äì Shows revenue and customer trends by city and age group, along with key metrics (DCG, DRG)  
3. **Age Group Analysis** ‚Äì Insights into revenue share, customer behavior, and policy preferences by age  
4. **Sales Mode Analysis** ‚Äì Evaluates performance of each sales channel across age groups

## ‚ú® Dashboard Highlights
##  KPI Highlights 
‚Ä¢	Total Customers: 26,841
‚Ä¢	Total Revenue: ‚Çπ989.3 Million
‚Ä¢	Daily Customer Growth: 149/day
‚Ä¢	Daily Revenue Growth: ‚Çπ5.47 Million/day
 
##  City-Wise Analysis
Delhi leads with nearly 40% of total revenue, while Indore lags behind with less than 10%. 
This highlights potential growth opportunities in underperforming regions like Indore, Chennai, and Hyderabad.

 
## Sales Mode Performance
Offline agents still dominate both in revenue and customer count.
However, we see a consistent rise in customers choosing online channels, especially the mobile app ‚Äî which grew from 4% to over 27% contribution

  
 ## Age Group Insights:
The 31‚Äì40 age group brings in 32% of total revenue, making it the most valuable segment. 
However, younger age groups like 18‚Äì24 are underperforming and present a strategic outreach opportunity. 
 

## Insurance premium-Level Analysis:
Lower premium policies like ‚Çπ5,000 sell the most in volume but contribute less to revenue. 
Meanwhile, high-value policies like ‚Çπ1,20,000 generate over 32% of total revenue, mainly purchased by older age groups.

 
 
## Monthly Trends
March shows the highest revenue ‚Äî nearly a 50% jump from February.
November is the weakest, 
suggesting seasonal dips and a need for campaigns during low-performing periods.
